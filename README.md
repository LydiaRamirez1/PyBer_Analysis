# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
Creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Using the Pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum() methods on PyBer DataFrame columns to get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then calculating the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type.
## Results
### Results by City Type
Rural cities have the least amount of rides, drivers, and total fares.
Urban cities have the greatest amount of rides, drivers, and total fares.
Suburban cities are in the middle having the second greatest amount of rides, drivers, and total fares.
While rural cities have the least amount of rides, drivers, and fares, they have the greatest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
In contrast, urban cities consist of the most rides, drivers, and fares, but they have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

## Summary
As far as addressing any disparities among the city types you can begin by charging more per mile in urban cities as the trips in such areas are most likely shorter distances and thus drivers do not earn as much per trip. Along with this, have more drivers assigned to the cities with the most ride requests, and make increases or descreases to ride fees based on how many riders there are in the city during certain times.
